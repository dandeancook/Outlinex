0.1.4

* Fixed issue where after closing outline sidebar, focus is on an empty tab

* When clicking on a symbol item in the outline pane, highlight in the main view depends on the setting `outline_main_view_highlight_mode`:

* `cursor`: no highlight, put cursor at the end of the symbol line
* `symbol`: highlight the current symbol (same as previous implementation)
* `block`: highlight the entire symbol block (i.e. between current and next symbol)
